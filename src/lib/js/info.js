    text: `This is the website of Koen Raijer. I am a medical doctor who studies data science based in Maastricht, the Netherlands. My interests lie in the field of psychiatry, and I do research on predicting when people are having intrusions from past traumatic events using physiological data and machine learning. This is where I share my thoughts on a non-specific set of topics, ranging from data science to psychiatry to philosophy. I'm sad to admit it's mostly tacky programming tutorials though, the reason being I can't stop myself from tweaking the website rather than writing posts`,
