Upon its original publication in 1969, Turkish Delight was a sensation and a scandal. Its graphic language and explicit sex scenes had an explosive effect, but just as revolutionary was its frank, colloquial style. The more straightlaced critics condemned the book, but readers saw a novel that reflected the way that they spoke, thought, and felt. Turkish Delight opens with a screed: a sculptor in his studio, raging against the love he lost and describing, in gory detail, the state of his life since she left him. Our narrator alternates between the story of his relationship with Olga\u2014its passion and affection, but also its obsessiveness and abuse\u2014and the dark days that followed, as he attempts to recapture what they had when they lived together, \u201chappy as beasts.\u201d The two only reunite during Olga\u2019s inexorable and tragic decline into cancer\u2014the chemo having taken her hair and rotted her teeth, she will only eat the soft, sweet Turkish Delight that her ex-lover brings to her bedside. In a new translation by Sam Garrett (Herman Koch\u2019s The Dinner), readers get a sense of Wolkers\u2019s revolutionary style and musical prose, Turkish Delight\u2019s particular balance of naked impulse and profound longing. Tin House Books gratefully acknowledges the support of the Dutch Foundation for Literature, whose generous subsidy made this new translation possible.","Date Published":"2017-03-07","Score (0-10)":"8+","Review":null,"Notes":null,"Date Finished":1391212800000.0,"Category":"Fiction"},{"ISBN":9025404006,"Added":1688860800000.0,"Title":"Overpeinzingen van een eenzame wandelaar","Subtitle":null,"Author":"Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Leo van Maris","Genre":null,"Description":"Autobiografisch getinte essays van de Franse pedagoog en wijsgeer (1712-1778).","Date Published":"1994","Score (0-10)":"8.5","Review":null,"Notes":null,"Date Finished":1393632000000.0,"Category":"Nonfiction"},{"ISBN":9029076445,"Added":1688860800000.0,"Title":"Kort Amerikaans","Subtitle":null,"Author":"Jan Wolkers","Genre":null,"Description":null,"Date Published":"2005","Score (0-10)":"8.5","Review":null,"Notes":null,"Date Finished":1393632000000.0,"Category":"Nonfiction"},{"ISBN":9023400763,"Added":1688860800000.0,"Title":"Een ellendige nietsnut","Subtitle":"en andere verhalen","Author":"Remco Campert","Genre":null,"Description":"Vijf novellen, waarin de verveling het hoofdmotief vormt.","Date Published":"1981","Score (0-10)":"6.5","Review":null,"Notes":null,"Date Finished":1393632000000.0,"Category":"Fiction"},{"ISBN":9789059652347,"Added":1688860800000.0,"Title":"A Beautiful Young Wife","Subtitle":null,"Author":"Tommy Wieringa","Genre":null,"Description":null,"Date Published":"2017-08","Score (0-10)":"6.5","Review":null,"Notes":null,"Date Finished":1393632000000.0,"Category":"Nonfiction"},{"ISBN":9780374500016,"Added":1688860800000.0,"Title":"Night","Subtitle":null,"Author":"Elie Wiesel","Genre":"Biography & Autobiography","Description":"A searing personal memoir of a boy who lived through the horrors of Auschwitz and Buchenwald.","Date Published":2006,"Score (0-10)":8,"Review":null,"Notes":null,"Date Finished":1393632000000.0,"Category":"Nonfiction"},{"ISBN":9789024563326,"Added":1688860800000.0,"Title":"The Ice Limit","Subtitle":null,"Author":"Douglas Preston, Lincoln Child","Genre":"Fiction","Description":"The largest known meteorite has been discovered, entombed in the earth for millions of years on a frigid, desolate island off the southern tip of Chile.

In a seaside town in the Netherlands, Mr Java - a war damaged ex-colonial - drills his son for the future, drawing him deeper and deeper into his delusionary world. As the radio broadcasts news of H bomb tests, Mr Java writes letters of complaint to the authorities, dreams of horses, and stands at the front window, on the look out for special security spies and nuclear holocaust. His wife and her three daughters from a previous marriage in Indonesia form a sort of Greek chorus, providing a sceptical commentary as his obsessions build towards a dark, absurdist climax. Repatriated is an inventive, blackly funny novel that shows an adolescent boy trying to break free from his parents and finding he cannot escape their past.","Date Published":"2016-03-07","Score (0-10)":8,"Review":null,"Notes":null,"Date Finished":1451606400000.0,"Category":"Fiction"},{"ISBN":9780140053203,"Added":1688860800000.0,"Title":"Travels with Charley","Subtitle":"In Search of America","Author":"John Steinbeck","Genre":"Travel","Description":"In 1960, when he was almost 60 years old, John Steinbeck set out to rediscover the United States, feeling he might have lost touch with its sights sounds and the essence of its people.

The bestselling author of On the Move, Musicophilia, and The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, Sacks is known for his illuminating case histories about people living with neurological conditions at the far borderlands of human experience. But his grasp of science was not restricted to neuroscience or medicine; he was fascinated by the issues, ideas, and questions of all the sciences. That wide-ranging expertise and passion informs the perspective of this book, in which he interrogates the nature not only of human experience but of all life. In The River of Consciousness, Dr. Sacks takes on evolution, botany, chemistry, medicine, neuroscience, and the arts, and calls upon his great scientific and creative heroes \u2013 above all, Darwin, Freud, and William James. For Sacks, these thinkers were constant companions from an early age; the questions they explored \u2013 the meaning of evolution, the roots of creativity, and the nature of consciousness \u2013 lie at the heart of science and of this book. The River of Consciousness demonstrates Sacks\u2019s unparalleled ability to make unexpected connections, his sheer joy in knowledge, and his unceasing, timeless endeavor to understand what makes us human.","Date Published":"2017-10-19","Score (0-10)":8,"Review":null,"Notes":null,"Date Finished":1456790400000.0,"Category":"Nonfiction"},{"ISBN":9028412123,"Added":1688860800000.0,"Title":"Aldus sprak Zarathoestra","Subtitle":"een boek voor allen en voor niemand","Author":"Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, Pieter Endt, Hendrik Marsman","Genre":null,"Description":"Filosofische leerstellingen over de \"Uebermensch\", geschreven in dichterlijk proza.","Date Published":"1972","Score (0-10)":9,"Review":null,"Notes":null,"Date Finished":1459468800000.0,"Category":"Nonfiction"},{"ISBN":9789035144392,"Added":1688860800000.0,"Title":"De duivelskunstenaar","Subtitle":null,"Author":"Pieter Steinz","Genre":null,"Description":null,"Date Published":null,"Score (0-10)":6.5,"Review":null,"Notes":null,"Date Finished":1464739200000.0,"Category":"Nonfiction"},{"ISBN":9789025302382,"Added":1688860800000.0,"Title":"La Superba","Subtitle":null,"Author":"Ilja Leonard Pfeijffer","Genre":"Fiction","Description":"\"An ode to the imagination.\"\u2014NRC Handelsblad A joy to read, La Superba, winner of the most prestigious Dutch literary prize, is a Rabelaisian, stylistic tour-de-force.
