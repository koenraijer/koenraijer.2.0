Further development ideas: 
- Under the hero, adda featured post that covers 2/3 of the width of the page. On the remaining one third, list all the categories
- Add pages for the categories

Why does the hero imaga placeholder show up on desktop but not on mobile?

New features: 
- Search Functionality: Local search functionality across all blog posts. Consider libraries like Fuse.js for client-side fuzzy search.
- Webmentions: These allow your site to gather reactions from around the web (likes, replies, retweets, etc.) and display them. A service like webmention.io can help with this.
- Image Optimization: Automatic resizing, lazy loading and optimization of images for better performance.
- Syntax Highlighting: For code blocks in your markdown, you might use a library like Prism.js.
